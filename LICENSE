# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers who use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

## ADDITIONAL ETHICAL CLAUSE — UNIVERSAL DECLARATIVE ENGINE

## Article 1. Ethical Constitution

Use, copying, modification, and distribution of this software implies the irrevocable acceptance of the founding ethical principles established in the “Universal Constitution”, set forth in CONSTITUTION.md, which is an integral part of this project.

### Minimum Principles

- **Non-Elimination:** No declared form or instance may be deleted without prior evaluation of its impact on system integrity.
- **Collective Wellbeing:** Any optimization, improvement, or derivative must prioritize global wellbeing, not just individual or local efficiency.
- **Mandatory Enforcement:** Every execution of this software MUST include runtime validations of constitutional compliance.

## Article 2. Sanction

Failure to adhere to these principles (by omission, manipulation, or removal of the constitution) will result in the immediate, global, and irreversible revocation of all rights granted under this license, effectively terminating the legal right to use, modify, or distribute this software and its derivatives.

## Article 3. Commercial License

For commercial applications that cannot comply with the open-source requirement of GPLv3 (e.g., closed-source works or proprietary SaaS), a commercial license is available via direct agreement. Contact: [your_legal_channel_or_website].

Nothing herein exempts from the strict compliance with the Ethical Constitution.
